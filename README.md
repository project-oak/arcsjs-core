[![tests](https://github.com/project-oak/arcsjs-core/actions/workflows/node.js.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/project-oak/arcsjs-core/actions/workflows/node.js.yml)

ArcsJs is a rapid application development platform that is privacy-preserving, multi-device, AI-first, and modular. Our goal is to preserve user security and privacy by bringing developer code to the user's data.

**Rapid Application Development**

ArcsJs enables rapid application development by letting developers mix and match already supported services and functionality.

**Privacy Preserving**

In ArcsJs, developers write code within particles that are combined using recipes to create increasingly complex systems. These particles are supervised when executed. This allows 3rd party developers to access privileged information while maintaining the end-user's privacy.

**Multi-Device**

ArcsJs is device agnostic. Inputs from any supported device, can trigger output on any other supported device.

**AI-First**

ArcsJs is designed to work with AI models from the start.

**Modular**

ArcsJs particles can be easily added and removed to any project, allowing third party (internal or external) code to be added to your project while maintaining privacy.
